Our commercial proposal ―NoteShares‖ is to link students and teachers of varied backgrounds. Students are encouraged to ask any questions they may have about any subject here, and qualified instructors will respond. Additionally, students may be rewarded for sharing their handwritten notes. Teachers frequently have the ability to review the answers. As a result, NoteShares will give both teachers and students economic independence.
The website seeks to encourage students to gain knowledge about new trends and technology as well as industry-related skills. Additionally, it gives teachers a way to discuss both curriculum-related and extracurricular subjects with learners. In the proposed effort, a centralized system for knowledge sharing will be attempted. The portal attempts to improve note hunting by offering an easy, quick, efficient, and superior system. Additionally, if effectively implemented, this will allow instructors and students to impart their knowledge through lectures as well.
